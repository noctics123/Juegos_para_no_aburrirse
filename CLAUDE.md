# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal repository called "Juegos_para_no_aburrirse" (Games to not get bored) that currently contains only a basic README.md file. The repository is a git repository but contains no source code files at this time.

## Current State

- **Repository Type**: Empty/starter repository
- **Main Files**: README.md only
- **Build System**: None currently configured
- **Programming Language**: Not yet determined
- **Testing Framework**: Not yet configured

## Development Commands

Since this is an empty repository with no build system or dependencies configured, there are currently no specific build, test, or development commands available.

## Architecture

The repository structure is minimal with only:
- README.md - Basic project description
- .git/ - Git version control files

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to reflect the chosen technology stack, build commands, and architectural decisions.
